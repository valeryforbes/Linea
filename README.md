why is gas fees so expensive on Linea testnet
Linea is currently in the #testnet phase. 

We’re thrilled to have such incredible community interest in a secure, scalable, and low-cost L2. 

But if you've been testing the Linea Voyage, you might wonder - why are gas fees increasing? Let's delve into why that is.
Linea, being a zkEVM, has to post data and proofs to Ethereum Layer 1. 

Since we are in the testnet phase, these proofs are posted to Goerli, the testnet Ethereum chain. This is a crucial part of our safety and validation process.In order to avoid overwhelming the Goerli network with our testing needs, we've taken the necessary steps to limit the number of transactions per batch. 

This was a strategic choice to keep the Goerli network manageable for developers during these early testing periods.

But during periods of high testnet activity, this limit leads to higher gas prices and fluctuating gwei. 

And due to gas intensive tasks from the DeFi week of Linea Voyage we’ve seen a huge spike in on-chain transactions as users compete to be included in blocks.
But not to worry. 

When Linea transitions from testnet to mainnet soon, we'll significantly increase throughput by increasing the batch capacity and speeding up block times. 

Gas fees will remain stable and orders of magnitude cheaper than the current price.We project that our mainnet gas prices will be up to 20x cheaper than what they are on Ethereum today. 

This means that Linea will offer high throughput and low fees, while maintaining strong security and fast finality.So while you test the exciting dapps on Linea during the DeFi Voyage, remember, it's all part of building a robust and efficient Layer 2 solution for you. 

We're excited about what's coming next for Linea!
